# ocConnect

Client launch tool for connecting to private Endlesss servers. Offers a server browser, reachability testing and a simple way to specify and launch plugin hosts to use the Endlesss VST with private servers.

Currently, building the tool requires you to bundle in a suitable `ourocosm.client.yaml` in `/assets/` listing the private servers to give the users access to.
